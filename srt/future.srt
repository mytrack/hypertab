1
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,956
Maya Angelou once said,

2
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:19,445
"A solitary fantasy can transform a million realities."

3
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:26,206
What dream or vision do you want to turn into reality?

4
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,991
I always wanted to go into business for myself.

5
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:31,204
I could be a consultant.

6
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:36,180
I'm going to go gluten free, right after I eat that last piece of chocolate cake.

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,185
(Laughter)

8
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:42,704
You know, one day I'm going to stand up to that crabby boss.

9
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,165
I look good on paper, I should feel great.

10
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:48,622
I just know there's more.

11
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,296
You know it because you feel it.

12
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:56,515
You lie awake at night. You talk about your dreams with your partner

13
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,927
and your friends, but more often than not,

14
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:04,629
you continue to do those same behaviors that keep you from making the change.

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,925
You ask yourself, "How can I make it happen?"

16
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:15,138
Research shows, the odds against you making a change in your life --

17
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,576
-- 9 to 1.

18
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:22,282
9 to 1, even if you're facing a life-threatening illness.

19
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:26,434
But let me show you how to beat those odds.

20
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:31,175
You can live the life you desire. It's right there in front of you.

21
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:36,201
But in order to achieve it, you must first see it, then believe it,

22
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:42,657
and then you must graciously ask and train your brain to help you

23
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:45,219
execute your vision.

24
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:47,999
So how do we see our vision?

25
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:50,089
Through a picture.

26
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:52,681
A picture can create movement.

27
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,566
A picture...

28
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:58,170
can unite nations,

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,100
a picture can pull at your heart

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,089
and fill you with a deep desire to do something.

31
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,634
At Roche Pharmaceutical, the president asked us to create a picture

32
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:09,719
of his vision.

33
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,579
Prior to having one, less than 40 percent of the employees understood

34
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,433
the company's vision and strategy.

35
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:24,938
After seeing this picture, 96 percent understood it, and 84 percent

36
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:30,493
understood how what they did everyday align to that picture.

37
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:35,369
So how can you use a picture to get what you want?

38
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:38,183
By simply drawing one.

39
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:41,386
You don't have to be an artist or know how to draw.

40
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:48,336
As naive as your drawings might be, when you draw where you are,

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,024
your current state, and where you want to be,

42
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:56,703
your desired new reality.

43
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:05,061
Suddenly, you have a road map for change.

44
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,300
So what is your current state?

45
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:09,535
Well, let's say you're Joe.

46
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:12,517
Joe has a good job.

47
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:18,279
Joe has a lovely wife, Amy.

48
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,321
Joe makes good money,

49
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:28,402
but like many of us, Joe wants more from life.

50
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:31,015
And he'd like to get rid of a couple of things.

51
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:36,729
Maybe that intense workload, maybe that negative boss.

52
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:44,393
Maybe Joe has a higher purpose; he's just not sure how to get there.

53
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:48,225
So, now, Joe's current state is visual.

54
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,536
We remember things better when they're attached to a picture.

55
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:54,602
65 percent better to be exact.

56
00:03:55,756 --> 00:04:00,953
So now let's imagine that Joe wants to change something in his current state.

57
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:06,178
He wants to build that desired new reality that he dreams about.

58
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,430
In order for Joe to freely dream,

59
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,319
he must first...

60
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:16,184
...trick his brain.

61
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,444
Because the left side of your brain, as you know, houses the critic,

62
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,632
who is forever trying to keep you safe from harm, make sure you

63
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:24,659
don't do anything dangerous or stupid.

64
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:30,185
So let's have Joe tell the critic that he's just going to use his imagination.

65
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:34,317
Using your imagination activates the right side of your brain,

66
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,690
which makes you creative and filled with possibility.

67
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:41,806
So now, let's dream Joe's new life.

68
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,320
In the best case scenario,

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,008
one year from today, what is Joe's life like?

70
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,498
Hey, Joe has a new job. Great.

71
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:57,686
Joe has a new boss, himself.

72
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,237
Joe has a couple of great collaborators,

73
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:06,680
and Joe is just bursting with creativity and ideas,

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,007
and all of those things we dream about.

75
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,019
Connection,

76
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,461
and purpose,

77
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:18,995
and freedom,

78
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:23,316
and love.

79
00:05:27,346 --> 00:05:30,166
Now I'm drawing this picture as the favor to Joe today.

80
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,394
But in real life, he'd have to draw his own picture.

81
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,721
Because he can't afford me.

82
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:38,779
(Laughter)

83
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,919
Actually, because you get the most power when you paint your own picture.

84
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,982
So now, Joe has his drawing,

85
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:48,764
so now he's got to soak it in.

86
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,441
He has to fill it with color.

87
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:55,229
He has to fill it with emotion.

88
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:03,541
He has to get inside of it, as if he's on the inside, looking out.

89
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:12,786
Your brain actually emits serotonin and Oxytocin when you draw and dream.

90
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,697
So you feel happy.

91
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,993
Capable, creative.

92
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:22,325
You feel cool.

93
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:27,209
So now, we have Joe's current state and Joe's desired new reality.

94
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:31,101
So how can Joe get from here to there

95
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,239
in just three bold steps?

96
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:37,146
Three bold steps?

97
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,423
If I knew how to get from here to there in three bold steps,

98
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:41,211
I would have done it 25 years ago

99
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,706
when I had a mullet.

100
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:45,511
(Laughter)

101
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:49,842
Here is where the magic begins. Your brain knows you.

102
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:54,216
It's cataloged everything you've ever seen, heard, experienced,

103
00:06:54,216 --> 00:06:56,419
real, or imagined.

104
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,296
You just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you.

105
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,194
It as simple as that.

106
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:04,828
We live in a three-dimensional world,

107
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:07,359
but the light falls on the retina in

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,460
a two-dimensional fashion, and the brain, it has to cope with it.

109
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,508
So how does it deal with this extra dimension?

110
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,775
It guesses.

111
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,143
It guesses!

112
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:23,623
And just as it can guess where your cup of coffee is when

113
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,841
it goes to pick it up, it can correctly guess

114
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:30,421
what the three bold steps are that you should take.

115
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:35,303
All you have to do is look at your picture and then close your eyes.

116
00:07:36,426 --> 00:07:41,563
This allows the brain to recycle what it sees and reconstruct it,

117
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:45,450
add to it everything you've ever seen, heard, experienced,

118
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:49,606
or fantasized about, and then it will serve you up

119
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,743
with the best possible solution.

120
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:55,385
If you just relax and you ask it,

121
00:07:55,385 --> 00:08:01,260
now what's the boldest thing I could do to get from here to there?

122
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,576
Boom, immediately it will tell you.

123
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,481
See it,

124
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:08,701
believe it,

125
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,827
act on it.

126
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:17,438
Now, the danger is, if any of those three bold steps are too scary,

127
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:19,580
this instinctual rational side of your brain

128
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,806
is going to try to talk you out of this.

129
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,073
Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to do that...

130
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,909
Oh, that desk it's not too small, my legs aren't cramped under there.

131
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:33,882
Oh, 20,000 a year, oh, that's a decent salary.

132
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,699
Oh, that boss, he's not that mean to me.

133
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,288
You know what, I'm just going to stay right here.

134
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:42,323
I feel really comfortable here.

135
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,914
So how can you get yourself to do the boldest thing?

136
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,223
By drawing the most compelling picture, so when you look here,

137
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,393
you're in pain, it hurts.

138
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:58,081
When you're here, you're ecstatic,

139
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:01,669
it's fantastic, you're already living inside that

140
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,019
connected and free life you drew.

141
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:11,378
So, everyday, you get up, you soak in your picture, you step into the possibility,

142
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,823
and this is the most important part, you act on it.

143
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:17,374
You do one small thing.

144
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,406
You call up that friend you know who started her own business,

145
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,381
you ask her "How did you do it?"

146
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,452
You ask Amy, "Will you support me in my vision?"

147
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:28,408
You go to your boss and you ask him for a raise.

148
00:09:28,993 --> 00:09:34,534
And you become that one person out of ten to make change happen.

149
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:39,219
Now, I put this template on your chairs,

150
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,367
so that you can do for yourself what I just did for Joe.

151
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,397
You've seen some fantastic ideas today that

152
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:47,989
have inspired your dream.

153
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,817
I dare you to draw that dream into that template.

154
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:58,577
I double dare you to choose a symbol in your drawing

155
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,787
that represents that desired new reality, take a picture

156
00:10:01,787 --> 00:10:05,202
of it with your phone and send it to us at TEDxRainier.

157
00:10:06,664 --> 00:10:12,779
Maya Angelou said, "A solitary fantasy can transform a million realities."

158
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,193
Just three bold steps can transform one reality, yours.

159
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,797
Thank you.

160
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:23,939
(Applause)
