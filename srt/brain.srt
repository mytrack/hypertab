1
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:16,293
So how do we learn?

2
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:21,005
And why does some of us learn things
more easily than others?


3
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:24,595
So, as I just mentioned,
I'm doctor Lara Boyd.

4
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:27,974
I am a brain researcher here
at the University of British Columbia.

5
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:31,147
These are the questions that fascinate me.

6
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:34,038
(Cheers) (Applause)

7
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,725
So brain research
is one of the great frontiers

8
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:41,244
in the understanding of human physiology,

9
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:45,278
and also in the consideration
of what makes us who we are.

10
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:47,904
It's an amazing time
to be a brain researcher,

11
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,173
and I would argue to you

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,944
that I have the most interesting job
in the world.

13
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:56,327
What we know about the brain
is changing at a breathtaking pace.

14
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:59,534
And much of what we thought we knew
and understood about the brain

15
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:02,745
turns out to be not true or incomplete.

16
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,974
Some of these misconceptions
are more obvious than others.

17
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:09,577
For example, we used to think

18
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:14,068
that after childhood the brain did not,
really could not change.

19
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:18,017
And it turns out that nothing
can be farther than the truth.

20
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:19,957
Another misconception about the brain

21
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:23,136
is that you only use parts of it
at any given time

22
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:25,716
and silent it when you do nothing.

23
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:27,533
Well, this is also untrue.

24
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:29,761
It turns out
that even when you're at a rest

25
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:33,473
and thinking of nothing,
your brain is highly active.

26
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:37,244
So it's been advances
in technology, such as MRI,

27
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:40,532
that's allowed us to make these
and many other important discoveries.

28
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,601
And perhaps the most exciting,

29
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,618
the most interesting
and transformative of these discoveries

30
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,351
is that, every time you learn
a new fact or skill,

31
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,231
you change your brain.

32
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,251
It's something we call neuroplasticity.

33
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,737
So as little as 25 years ago,
we thought that after about puberty,

34
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,784
the only changes that took place
in the brain were negative:

35
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:03,994
the loss of brain cells with aging,

36
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,636
resulted damage, like a stroke.

37
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:09,899
And then, studies began
to show remarkable amounts

38
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,978
of reorganization in the adult brain.

39
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:15,844
And the ensuing research has shown us

40
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,366
that all of our behaviors
change our brain.

41
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:23,015
That these changes are not limited by age,

42
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,722
it's a good news right?

43
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,397
And in fact,
they are taking place all the time.

44
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,529
And very importantly,

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,398
brain reorganization helps
to support recovery

46
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,474
after you damage your brain.

47
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,668
The key to each of these changes
is neuroplasticity.

48
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,204
So what does it looks alike?

49
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:44,201
So your brain can change
in three very basic ways

50
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,960
to support learning.

51
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:48,000
And the first is chemical.

52
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:51,574
So brain actually functions
by transferring chemicals signals

53
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,709
between brain cells,
what we called neurons,

54
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,148
and this triggered series
of actions and reactions.

55
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:00,267
So to support learning,
your brain can increase the amount

56
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:03,454
through the concentrations
of these chemical signaling

57
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,459
that's taking place between neurons.

58
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:09,021
Because this change can happen rapidly,

59
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,978
this supports short term memory

60
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,019
or the short term improvement
in the performance of a motor skill.

61
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,799
The second way that the brain
can change to support learning

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,934
is by altering its structure.

63
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:25,493
So during learning, the brain can change
the connections between neurons.

64
00:03:25,494 --> 00:03:28,742
Here, the physical structure
of the brain is actually changing

65
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,899
so this takes a bit more time.

66
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,685
These type of changes are related
to long term memory,

67
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:37,037
the long term improvement
in a motor skill.

68
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:41,004
These processes interact,
and let me give you an example of how.

69
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:44,742
We've all tried to learn
a new motor skill,

70
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,382
maybe playing the piano,

71
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:48,243
maybe learning to juggle.

72
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:50,923
You've had the experience
of getting better and better

73
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:53,201
within a single session of practice,

74
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,700
and thinking "I have got it."

75
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,840
And then, maybe you return the next day,

76
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:01,292
and all those improvements
from the day before are lost.

77
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:02,792
What happened?

78
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:05,822
Well, in the short term,
your brain was able to increase

79
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,585
the chemical signaling
between your neurons.

80
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:13,480
But for some reason, those changes
did not induce the structural changes

81
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,507
that are necessary
to support long term memory.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,591
Remember that
long term memories take time.

83
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,725
And what you see in the short term
does not reflect learning,

84
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,473
It's these physical changes

85
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,853
that are now going to support
long term memories,

86
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:31,764
and chemical changes
that support short term memories.

87
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:36,876
Structural changes also can lead
to integrated networks of brain regions

88
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:39,225
that function together
to support learning.

89
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:41,572
And it can also lead
to certain brain regions

90
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,212
that are important
for very specific behaviors

91
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:46,808
to change your structure or to enlarge.

92
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:49,318
So here's some examples of that.

93
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,201
People who read Braille

94
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:56,616
have larger hand sensory areas
in their brain than those of us who don't.

95
00:04:56,617 --> 00:05:00,934
Your dominant hand motor region,
which is on the left side of your brain,

96
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:04,797
if you are right-handed,
is larger than the other side.

97
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,781
And research shows
the London taxi cab drivers

98
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:12,424
who actually have to memorize a map
of London to get their taxi cab license,

99
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:17,210
they have larger brain regions devoted
to spacial, or mapping memories.

100
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,808
The last way that your brain
can change to support learning

101
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:22,539
is by altering its function.

102
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,551
As you use a brain region,

103
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:29,311
It becomes more and more excitable
and easy to use again.

104
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,883
And as your brain has these areas
that increase their excitability,

105
00:05:32,884 --> 00:05:35,949
the brain shifts
how and when they are activated.

106
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,599
With learning, we see

107
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:41,611
that whole networks of brain activity
are shifting and changing.

108
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,377
So neuroplasticity is supported

109
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:48,752
by chemical, by structural,
and by functional changes,

110
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:51,601
and these are happening
across the whole brain.

111
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,952
They can occur in isolation
from one or another,

112
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,333
but most often,
they take place in concert.

113
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:59,662
Together, they support learning.

114
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,354
And they're taking place all the time.

115
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:08,914
I just told you really
how awesomely neuroplastic your brain is.

116
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:13,094
Why can't you learn anything
you choose to with ease?

117
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:16,311
Why do our kids sometimes fail in school?

118
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,633
Why as we age
do we tend to forget things?

119
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:23,948
And why don't people fully recover
from brain damage?

120
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,397
That is: what is it that limits
and facilitates neuroplasticity?

121
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:31,407
And so this is what I study.

122
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:35,691
I study specifically how it relates
to recovery from stroke.

123
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:36,936
Recently, stroke dropped

124
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:40,386
from being the third leading cause
of the death in the United States

125
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:42,496
to be the forth leading cause
of the death.

126
00:06:42,497 --> 00:06:44,237
Great news, right?

127
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,319
But actually, it turns out

128
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,359
that the number of people
having a stroke has not declined.

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,699
We are just better at keeping
people alive after a severe stroke.

130
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:58,094
It turns out to be very difficult
to help the brain recover from stroke.

131
00:06:58,096 --> 00:06:59,372
And frankly,

132
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:03,462
we have failed to develop
effective rehabilitation interventions.

133
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:09,568
The net result of this
is that stroke is the leading cause

134
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:13,739
of long term disability
in adults in the world;

135
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,818
individuals with stroke are younger

136
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:18,938
and tending to live longer
with that disability,

137
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,143
and research from my group actually shows

138
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:25,952
that the health related quality of life
of Canadians with stroke has declined.

139
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,219
So clearly we need to be better

140
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,306
at helping people recover from stroke.

141
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,708
This is an enormous societal problem,

142
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:36,273
and it's one that we are not solving.

143
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,504
So what can be done?

144
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:41,291
One thing is absolutely clear:

145
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:45,792
the best driver of neuroplastic change
in your brain is your behavior.

146
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,332
The problem is that the dose
of behavior, the dose of practice

147
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,935
that's required to learn
new and relearn old motor skills,

148
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,551
is very large.

149
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:58,827
And how to effectively deliver
these large doses of practice

150
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:03,208
is a very difficult problem;
It's also a very expensive problem.

151
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,388
So the approach
that my research has taken

152
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,296
is to develop therapies that prime
or that prepare the brain to learn.

153
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:14,031
And these have included brain simulation,
exercise, and robotics.

154
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:18,220
But through my research,
I've realized that a major limitation

155
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,764
to the development of therapies
that speed recovery from stroke

156
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:27,751
is that patterns of neuroplasticity
are highly variable from person to person.

157
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:32,596
As a researcher,
variability used to drive me crazy.

158
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,866
It makes it very difficult
to use the statistics

159
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,390
to test your data and your ideas.

160
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,347
And because of this,
medical intervention studies are

161
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,089
specifically designed
to minimize variability.

162
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,334
But in my research,
it's becoming really clear

163
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:52,688
that the most important,
the most informative data we collect

164
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:55,060
is showing this variability.

165
00:08:56,571 --> 00:09:00,972
So by studying the brain
after stroke, we've learned a lot,

166
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:05,781
and I think these lessons
are very valuable in other areas.

167
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:07,881
The first lesson is

168
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:11,973
that the primary driver of change
in your brain is your behavior,

169
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:15,334
so there is no neuroplasticity drug
you can take.

170
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:19,367
Nothing is more effective than practice
at helping you learn,

171
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:23,164
and the bottom line
is you have to do the work.

172
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,593
And in fact, my research has shown

173
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:30,767
increased difficulty, increased struggle
if you will, during practice,

174
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:32,934
actually leads to both more learning,

175
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:36,334
and greater structural change
in the brain.

176
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:42,524
The problem here is that neuroplastcity
can work both ways.

177
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:45,338
It can be positive,
you learn something new,

178
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:47,928
and you refine a motor skill.

179
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:51,692
And it also can be negative though,
you forgot something you once knew,

180
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:53,908
you become addicted to drugs,

181
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,937
maybe you have chronic pain.

182
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:58,614
So your brain is tremendously plastic,

183
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:03,314
and it's been shaped both structurally
and functionally by everything you do,

184
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:06,470
but also by everything that you don't do.

185
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,801
The second lesson
we've learned about brain

186
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:13,722
is that there is
no one-size-fits-all approach to learning.

187
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,587
So there is no recipe for learning.

188
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:20,515
Consider the popular belief
that it takes 10,000 hours of practice

189
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:23,724
to learn and to master a new motor skill.

190
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:27,065
I can assure you
it's not quite that simple.

191
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,198
For some of us,

192
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:32,818
it's going to take a lot more practice,
and for others it may take far less.

193
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,766
So the shaping of our plastic brains
is far too unique

194
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:41,237
for there to be any single intervention
that's going to work for all of us.

195
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:46,258
This realization has forced us to consider
something call personalized medicine.

196
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,227
This is the idea that to optimize outcomes

197
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:53,007
each individual requires
their own intervention.

198
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:55,752
And the idea actually comes
from cancer treatments.

199
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:59,338
And here it turns out that genetics
are very important in matching

200
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,739
certain types of chemotherapy
with specific forms of cancer.

201
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:08,223
My research is showing that this
also applies to recovery from stroke.

202
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:11,317
There're certain characteristics
of brain structure and function

203
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,584
we called biomarkers.

204
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:15,168
And these biomarkers
are proving to be very helpful

205
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,092
and helping us to match

206
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,958
specific therapies
with individual patients.

207
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,792
The data for my lab suggests
it's a combination of biomarkers

208
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:29,584
that best predicts neuroplastic change
and patterns of recovery after stroke.

209
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:34,170
And that's not surprising, given
how complicated the human brain is.

210
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:38,661
But I also think we can consider
this concept much more broadly.

211
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:43,776
Given the unique structure
and function of each of our brains

212
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:49,042
what we've learned about neuroplasticity
after stroke applies to everyone.

213
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:54,804
Behaviors that you employ
in your everyday life are important.

214
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,532
Each of them is changing your brain.

215
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,275
And I believe we have to consider

216
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:03,354
not just personalized medicine
but personalized learning.

217
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,831
The uniqueness
of your brain will affect you

218
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:08,981
both as a learner and also as a teacher.

219
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:11,938
This idea helps us to understand

220
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,738
why some children can thrive
in tradition education settings

221
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,348
and others don't;

222
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:19,719
why some of us can learn languages easily

223
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,730
and yet, others can pick up
any sport and excel.

224
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,381
So when you leave this room today,

225
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,891
your brain will not be the same
as when you entered this morning.

226
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:35,549
And I think that's pretty amazing.

227
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,002
But each of you is going to have changed
your brain differently.

228
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,706
Understanding these differences,

229
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:46,335
these individual patterns,
these variability and change

230
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:49,835
is going to enable
the next great advance in neuroscience;

231
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:53,596
it's going to allow us to develop
new and more effective interventions,

232
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:57,906
and allow for matches
between learners and teachers,

233
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,906
and patients and interventions.

234
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:03,986
And this does not just apply
the recovery from stroke,

235
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:08,488
it applies to each of us, as a parent,
as a teacher, as a manager,

236
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:12,869
and also because you are
at TEDx today, as a lifelong learner.

237
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,897
Study how and what you learn best.

238
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,738
Repeat those behaviors
that are healthy for your brain,

239
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:23,936
and break those behaviors
and habits that are not.

240
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:25,518
Practice.

241
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,487
Learning is about doing the work
that your brain requires.

242
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:34,320
So the best strategies
are going to vary between individuals.

243
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:37,537
You know what, they're even going
to vary within individuals.

244
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:40,508
So for you, learning music
may come very easily,

245
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,748
but learning to snowboard, much harder.

246
00:13:44,478 --> 00:13:46,287
I hope that you leave today

247
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:49,908
with a new appreciation
of how magnificent your brain is.

248
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:54,681
You and your plastic brain are constantly
being shaped by the world around you.

249
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,136
Understand that everything you do,

250
00:13:57,137 --> 00:14:01,656
everything you encounter, and everything
you experience is changing your brain.

251
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:05,856
And that can be for better,
but it can also be for worse.

252
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:10,328
So when you leave today,
go out and build the brain you want.

253
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,546
Thank you very much.

254
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,251
(Applause)
